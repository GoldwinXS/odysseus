## What is this fork(ing) doing here?

Fair question. This is a friendly fork of [pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus) — the same app at its core, but I've been living in it daily and fixing the things that annoyed me until it felt trustworthy rather than just capable.

The gist of what's different here, roughly, and without promising it'll stay exactly this list:

- **Fewer surprises.** A lot of work went into making failures *loud and recoverable* instead of silent — turns that used to quietly die, tool calls that vanished, and errors that showed up as a blank message now surface something you (or the model) can act on.
- **Real background agents.** Sub-agents you can dispatch, watch, steer, and that actually report back into the chat — plus a configurable (cheap) default model just for them, so routine work doesn't cost frontier-model money.
- **Steer mid-reply.** Type while the agent is working and your message joins the turn instead of waiting for it to finish.
- **The model can find its own tools** instead of being stuck with whatever was pre-selected, and it fails gracefully when it reaches for something that isn't loaded.
- **Cheaper by default.** Prompt caching, per-role model routing, and local-model friendliness so you can run most of it for near-free and only spend on the hard parts.
- **Assorted polish** — steadier long tasks, saner timeouts, and a pile of small UI fixes I hit while using it.

None of this is meant to drift away from upstream — the plan is to contribute the good bits back. If you just want to run it, everything below works the same as upstream. If you're curious what actually changed, the commit history is chatty on purpose.

## Quick Start

> `dev` is the default branch and gets the newest changes first. Use [`main`](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/tree/main) if you want the more curated branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:7000` when the containers are healthy. The first admin password is printed in `docker compose logs odysseus`.

Native installs, GPU notes, Windows/macOS instructions, HTTPS, and configuration live in the [setup guide](docs/setup.md).

## Features

- **Chat + Agents** — local/API models, tools, MCP, files, shell, skills, and memory.
- **Cookbook** — hardware-aware model recommendations, downloads, and serving.
- **Deep Research** — multi-step web research with source reading and report generation.
- **Compare** — blind side-by-side model testing and synthesis.
- **Documents** — writing-first editor with AI edits, suggestions, Markdown, HTML, CSV, and syntax highlighting.
- **Email** — IMAP/SMTP inbox with triage, tags, summaries, reminders, and reply drafts.
- **Notes, Tasks + Calendar** — reminders, todos, scheduled agent tasks, and CalDAV sync.
- **Extras** — gallery/image editor, themes, uploads, web search, presets, sessions, and 2FA.

## Demo

A full hover-to-play tour lives on the landing page: [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html).

## Contributing

Help is welcome. The best entry points are fresh-install testing, provider setup bugs, mobile/editor polish, docs, and small focused refactors. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Security

Odysseus is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools. Keep auth enabled, keep private data out of Git, and do not expose raw model/service ports publicly. Deployment details are in the [setup guide](docs/setup.md#security-notes).
